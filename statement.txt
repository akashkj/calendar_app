Summary
The goal of this tool is to enable users to perform “Calendar Audit.” The purpose of
this audit is to help users to track how much time they are spending on meetings, and
if they are conducting the right meetings and spending their time on the right goals.
This tool will look at a user's calendar and generate a report detailing the time spent
by the user.
